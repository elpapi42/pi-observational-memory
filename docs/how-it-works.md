# How it works

This is the V3 technical reference for `pi-observational-memory`.

V3 is ledger-centered: memory state is reconstructed by folding V3 ledger entries on the current branch. When that projection is non-empty, V3 renders it model-free into the summary the agent sees. Empty projections delegate to OMP's native summarizer.

## Runtime entry points

`src/index.ts` registers one shared runtime and these OMP surfaces:

| Surface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `turn_end` observer trigger | Maybe run the observer in the background. |
| `turn_end` reflect/drop trigger | Maybe run the due reflector, then run dropper maintenance only after same-run successful reflection. |
| `agent_settled` compaction trigger | Maybe call `ctx.compact()` when idle and over `compactAfterTokens`, after OMP finishes retries and queued continuation. |
| `session_before_compact` hook | Build the V3 compaction payload deterministically. |
| `/om:status` | Show ledger counts, drift, progress clocks, and worker state. |
| `/om:view` | Show visible or full memory content and attempt to copy the rendered memory text. |
| `recall` tool | Recover source evidence for a memory id. |

The observer has priority. Reflect/drop does not run on a turn where observer work is due.

## Source entries and progress

V3 raw-token progress counts only source entries:

- `message`
- `custom_message`
- `branch_summary`

Memory ledger entries and compaction entries do not add raw-token progress.

Every V3 ledger entry has `data.coversUpToId`. That field is a progress and projection watermark. Worker clocks count raw/source tokens after the latest valid watermark for that worker's ledger type:

| Worker/trigger | Progress source |
|---|---|
| Observer | latest `om.observations.recorded.data.coversUpToId` |
| Reflector | latest `om.reflections.recorded.data.coversUpToId` |
| Dropper | latest `om.observations.dropped.data.coversUpToId` |
| Auto-compaction | latest compaction boundary |

The watermark is also used to decide whether a memory ledger entry belongs to a bounded projection. It is not provenance. Provenance lives in `sourceEntryIds` and `supportingObservationIds`.

## Ledger data shapes

### Observations recorded

```ts
customType: "om.observations.recorded"
data: {
  observations: Observation[];
  coversUpToId: string;
}
```

Each observation:

```ts
type Observation = {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: string;
  relevance: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical";
  sourceEntryIds: string[];
  tokenCount: number;
}
```

The builder rejects empty observation arrays, so no empty progress entries are written.

### Reflections recorded

```ts
customType: "om.reflections.recorded"
data: {
  reflections: Reflection[];
  coversUpToId: string;
}
```

Each reflection:

```ts
type Reflection = {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  supportingObservationIds: string[];
  tokenCount: number;
}
```

The reflector must cite valid active observation ids.

### Observations dropped

```ts
customType: "om.observations.dropped"
data: {
  observationIds: string[];
  coversUpToId: string;
}
```

Drops are tombstones. They remove ids from active observations but do not delete ledger history.

### Folded compaction details

```ts
details: {
  type: "om.folded";
  version: 1;
  fullFold: boolean;
  observations: Observation[];
  reflections: Reflection[];
}
```

These details are what later visible projections read. The ledger remains the source of truth.

## Observer flow

The observer trigger runs on `turn_end`.

1. Load config if needed.
2. Skip if `passive` is true.
3. Skip if `observerInFlight` is true.
4. Count raw/source tokens since latest observation coverage.
5. Skip if below `observeAfterTokens`.
6. Honor any deliberate-empty backoff until another `observeAfterTokens` of source tokens arrive.
7. Select the oldest size-capped chunk after the latest observation coverage marker.
8. Serialize those source entries for the observer prompt.
9. Resolve the memory model.
10. Run `runObserver()` in a background task.
11. Validate source ids returned by the model.
12. Compute deterministic 12-character ids and per-observation token counts in code.
13. Append `om.observations.recorded` only if at least one observation was accepted.

If no observations are generated, the worker writes no entry and does not advance coverage. A later eligible observer run will see a larger range. Deliberate empty runs back off until another `observeAfterTokens` worth of new source tokens arrives, so they do not re-fire every turn. Observer chunks target a fixed 60,000 estimated tokens, oldest-first, so an oversized uncovered span drains in slices; the oldest entry is always included even if it alone exceeds the target, preventing coverage from stalling. API/stream failures surface as `observer failed` / `observer.stream_error` rather than as an empty run.

## Reflect/drop flow

Reflect/drop also runs on `turn_end`, but only when the observer is not due.

1. Load config if needed.
2. Skip if `passive` is true.
3. Skip if observer or reflect/drop work is already in flight.
4. Skip if observer progress has reached `observeAfterTokens`.
5. Check the reflector raw-token clock against `reflectAfterTokens`.
6. Resolve the model only for stages that are ready to run.
7. Fold current ledger state.
8. If reflector is due and observation coverage exists, run the reflector. Each active observation line is annotated with current reflection coverage (`none`, `partial`, or `strong`) so the reflector can review uncovered durable facts without treating coverage as a quota.
9. Append non-empty `om.reflections.recorded` with `coversUpToId` set to the latest observation coverage marker. Support ids are downstream dropper coverage evidence and should include all and only observations whose durable meaning is preserved with equivalent fidelity.
10. Only after that same-run non-empty reflection append, check whether the folded active observation pool is over `observationsPoolTargetTokens`.
11. If over target, run the dropper with same-turn reflections available. It computes a maximum drop count from tokens over target converted to an approximate observation count and annotates active observations with reflection coverage tiers (`none`, `partial`, `strong`) for model judgment.
12. Append non-empty `om.observations.dropped` with `coversUpToId` set to the earlier branch position of latest observation coverage and same-run reflection coverage.

Reflector no-output and reflector failure skip same-turn dropper. Dropper failure does not roll back already-appended reflections.

## Auto-compaction trigger

The auto-compaction trigger runs on `agent_settled`, after OMP has finished automatic retries, automatic compaction, and queued continuation.

It skips when:

- `passive` is true;
- compaction is already in flight;
- estimated source-entry progress after the latest compaction boundary is below `compactAfterTokens`;
- OMP is not idle after the deferred check;
- the raw threshold is no longer met after the deferred check.

The count starts at `firstKeptEntryId` when OMP provides that boundary. Memory
ledger entries and compaction metadata contribute zero. The trigger uses this
same raw metric before scheduling and in the deferred re-check, then calls
`ctx.compact()` when all checks pass.

This trigger does not wait for observer, reflector, or dropper promises. That is intentional: background memory work should never make compaction feel stuck.

## Compaction hook

The compaction hook runs on `session_before_compact` and is the critical V3 latency path.

It does only deterministic work:

1. Guard against duplicate concurrent compaction hooks.
2. Load config if needed.
3. Read `event.preparation.firstKeptEntryId` and `event.preparation.tokensBefore`.
4. Build a compaction projection from branch entries and `firstKeptEntryId`.
5. Render a summary from projected reflections and observations.
6. If the summary is empty, return no extension result so OMP uses native compaction.
7. Otherwise return `{ compaction: { summary, firstKeptEntryId, tokensBefore, details } }` where `details.type` is `om.folded`.

It does not:

- call a model;
- run a sync observer;
- run reflector/dropper;
- wait for worker promises;
- append ledger entries.

If another compaction hook is already in flight, it returns `{ cancel: true }`. Delegating an empty projection is intentionally different: OMP proceeds with its native summarizer so pre-cut context is preserved.

## Projections

V3 uses projection helpers so commands, compaction, and recall do not each invent their own truth.

### Full projection

Full projection folds valid V3 observations, reflections, and drops from branch root through the requested boundary. Memory entries are included by resolving their `data.coversUpToId` marker against the boundary, not by the physical position of the `om.*` custom entry. Old V2 entries/details, invalid V3-shaped entries, and dangling coverage markers are ignored.

### Visible projection

Visible projection without a boundary reads the latest V3 `om.folded` compaction details. This is what the agent currently sees.

### Compaction projection

When compaction runs, the projection helper decides whether this compaction is a full fold. It first builds the normal compaction projection: observations whose `coversUpToId` reaches `firstKeptEntryId`, with reflection/drop effects held stable from the latest full-fold boundary. If there is no previous full-fold boundary, normal compaction includes observations only and excludes reflections/drops. It sums that projection's active observation `tokenCount`; if the total is at or above `observationsPoolMaxTokens`, it performs a full fold through `firstKeptEntryId`, applying observations, reflections, and drops by coverage marker. Otherwise, it keeps the normal projection.

### Diff projection

Diff projection compares visible memory with full memory. `/om:status` uses this to show recorded-vs-visible drift. `/om:status` also reports the visible observation pool separately from the folded active observation pool because compaction pressure and dropper maintenance intentionally use different projections and thresholds.

## Summary rendering

The renderer returns an empty string when there are no visible observations or reflections. Otherwise it starts with deterministic usage instructions that tell the agent how to treat the memory, how to handle conflicts, and when to use `recall` for exact source context. It then renders reflection and observation sections when those entries exist:

```md
These are condensed memories from earlier in this session.

- Reflections: stable, long-lived facts about the user, project, decisions, and constraints. New reflection lines may include ids in brackets.
- Observations: timestamped events from the conversation history, in chronological order. Observation lines include ids in brackets.

Treat these as past records. When entries conflict, the most recent observation reflects the latest known state. Work that prior observations describe as completed should not be redone unless the user explicitly asks to revisit it.

When exact source context is needed for precision or traceability, use the recall tool with the relevant observation or reflection id. This is especially useful when a reflection materially affects a decision or is too compressed to continue confidently. Do not use recall as broad search or inject raw source unless it is needed.

## Reflections
[id] durable reflection

## Observations
[id] YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [relevance] timestamped observation
```

The renderer is deterministic. It does not call a model and does not rewrite memory content.

## OMP activation boundary

Every OMP runtime starts with observational memory disabled. The only activation
path is the bare, one-shot `/om` command. It is available in the parent OMP TUI
and in an externally controlled OMP RPC session; print and JSON modes reject the
command, and native child sessions have no command channel.

Activation is held in memory for the current session only. OMP restart, resume,
fork, or new-session boundaries require `/om` again and never write an enabled
marker to settings, session entries, or another sidecar file.

When `passive: true`, `/om` is a hard lockout. While disabled, `/om:status`,
`/om:view`, and `recall` return only `Observational memory is disabled; run /om
to enable it.` without reading the branch, resolving a model, or touching the
clipboard. The `recall` tool is also removed from the active model-tool
allowlist until activation, and is restored only if it was active before gating.

Disabled or passive workers do not launch, proactive compaction does not run,
and the compaction hook delegates to OMP's native compaction. Once enabled, an
empty observational projection still delegates natively; a non-empty projection
owns the compaction summary.

## Commands

### `/om:status`

Shows:

- recorded/dropped/visible observation counts, with plain `+N` / `-N` visible-vs-full drift suffixes when drift exists;
- recorded/visible reflection counts, with a plain `+N` drift suffix when full memory has extra reflections;
- next observation/reflection/compaction token progress and drop coverage since the last successful drop;
- visible observation pool pressure against `observationsPoolMaxTokens` from the current compaction projection;
- active observation pool pressure against `observationsPoolTargetTokens` from folded active observations;
- dropper state explaining whether the active pool is under target or waiting for the next successful reflection;
- reflection pool token total;
- passive mode;
- worker in-flight flags;
- last observer and reflect/drop errors.

### `/om:view`

Default mode shows visible memory and attempts to copy the rendered memory text to the clipboard. If no V3 compaction has happened yet, visible memory can be empty because nothing has been folded into `om.folded` details; use `/om:view full` to inspect recorded branch memory before the first compaction.

Clipboard copy uses platform clipboard commands (`pbcopy`, `clip`, `wl-copy`, `xclip`, `xsel`, or `termux-clipboard-set`). If copying succeeds, OMP shows `Copied /om:view output to clipboard.` If copying fails, the command still prints the memory view and shows a warning. The clipboard text is only the rendered memory content; it does not include the success/failure line.

### `/om:view full`

Shows full V3 ledger truth at branch tip and attempts to copy the rendered memory text to the clipboard using the same success/failure behavior as default `/om:view`.

## Recall flow

The agent-facing `recall` tool accepts a 12-character lowercase hex id.

1. Validate id shape.
2. Read the current branch.
3. Index V3 observations, reflections, and drops from ledger history.
4. Match the id against observations and reflections.
5. For observations, mark status as `active` or `dropped`.
6. Resolve observation source entries from `sourceEntryIds`.
7. For reflections, resolve supporting observations and their sources.
8. Return exact evidence plus diagnostics for missing/non-source entries.

Recall ignores old V2 memory by construction because it indexes only V3 ledger entry types.

## Error and race handling

- Worker in-flight flags prevent duplicate observer or reflect/drop runs.
- Observer priority prevents reflect/drop from advancing while source text is due for observation.
- No-output workers append no empty ledger entries.
- Invalid source/support/drop ids are filtered or rejected by code.
- Background worker errors are recorded on runtime state and surfaced in `/om:status`.
- Compaction does not wait for background workers; it folds whatever ledger state is already present.
- Historical or invalid coverage markers are tolerated by progress helpers instead of throwing.

## V2 behavior

V3 does not use V2 state shapes. Old V2 custom memory entries, old V2 compaction details, and old V2 config keys are ignored. Existing old visible compaction text in a continued session may remain visible until a V3 compaction replaces it. The recommended upgrade path is to update settings and start a new clean session.

## Invariants

- The branch-local V3 ledger is the memory source of truth.
- OMP compaction summaries represent what the agent sees.
- Non-empty V3 compaction projections are deterministic and model-free; empty projections delegate to OMP's native summarizer.
- Observer input is raw/source entries only.
- `coversUpToId` is a progress/projection watermark, not provenance.
- Kept observations and reflections are rendered without paraphrase.
- Dropped observations remain recallable from ledger history.
- Old V2 memory is ignored rather than migrated.

## Testing

`bun run test` runs the Vitest suite, which drives the extension against a
simulated `ExtensionContext` — including the disabled/passive/enabled
activation gates and the lifecycle-reset behavior described above.

`bun run test:smoke` runs a separate black-box smoke test against a real OMP
TUI session, independent OMP RPC sessions, and a real in-process child
`AgentSession` (OMP's native subagent mechanism). It proves the parent TUI and
RPC sessions can activate observational memory through `/om` while a spawned
subagent stays disabled with native compaction. It requires the `omp` CLI and
Python 3 for the TUI PTY bridge and is intentionally outside `bun run test`'s
scope. See `tests/smoke/README.md` for prerequisites and invocation.
